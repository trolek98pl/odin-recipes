            <li>1 garlic clove, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 c. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. Kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong class="dish_parts">FOR PIZZA</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>3 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/2" pieces</li>
            <li>1 (9-oz)  ball store-bought pizza dough </li>
            <li>all-purpose flour, for peel, pan, or cutting board</li>
            <li>1 c. freshly shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>1/4 c. freshly grated parmesan</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong><br>
        For chili oil (optional): Combine chili flakes and garlic in a medium heatproof bowl. In a small pot over medium heat, heat oil until hot but not yet smoking, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour over chili flake mixture, stir, and set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 2</strong><br>
        Preheat oven to 500° and place a baking sheet in the middle rack.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 3</strong><br>
        In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until mostly crisp but still slightly bendable. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 4</strong><br>
        Stretch or roll pizza dough into an 10” to 11” round, and place on a well-floured pizza peel, cutting board, or upside-down baking sheet. (You will be using this to transfer your pizza to your preheated baking sheet. Make sure your crust is moving freely and not sticking anywhere.)
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 5</strong><br>
        Top your dough with an even layer of mozzarella and parmesan, avoiding the very center (to allow room for an egg) and a 1” border around the outside for crust. Scatter cooked bacon all over pizza.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 6</strong><br>
        Remove hot baking sheet from oven and carefully transfer prepared pizza onto it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 7</strong><br>
        Bake for 9 to 10 minutes, until golden and melty, then carefully crack egg into the center of the pizza. (You can also crack the egg into a small bowl and pour it onto the pizza.) Return pizza to oven and bake until egg white is set but yolk is still runny, 2 to 3 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 8</strong><br>
        Season egg with salt and pepper, and drizzle chili oil on finished pie. Break into yolk and drizzle all over pizza.
